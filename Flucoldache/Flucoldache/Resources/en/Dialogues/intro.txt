Jacob
My lord... Villagers are here.
Von Neumann
Tell those bucketheads to go away. I don't want to listen to their babble\again.
Jacob
This time they came with axes and torches. Seems like they're going to break\the gate.
Von Neumann
Goddamn idiots, they just have to always poke their noses into things that\are none of their business. How many are them?
Jacob
About thirty. Also one hundred of soldies has arrived in the village a couple\of hours ago. 
Von Neumann
Bad. Very, very bad. I didn't want to do that, but sometimes science requires\sacrifice.
Von Neumann
Take my glasses with diseases. I have only modified cold on me, but I think, you'll be able\to make some more yourself along the way.
Von Neumann
There are also miniature laboratory and my book in the corner. Take everything and go to the\village. Infect them, poison them, do anything, but don't let them take the mansion. 
Von Neumann
I need just a couple of hours - and then my magnum opus will be complete.
Jacob
Are you telling me... to kill them all?
Von Neumann
They left us no choice. I'm not going to abandon twelve years of hard work because of a\bunch of dumb cowards.
